            I want to join the water polo club so that I can practice my swimming. I have never been a strong swimmer, so I'd like to take this opportunity
				to practice and meet new people. I am a bioengineering major with a minor in CS. An interesting fact about myself is that I was adopted from
				South Korea when I was 4 months old. Pleasure to meet y'all!
